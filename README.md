# MathLitNotes

Personal notes with details on some literature in social science but with lots of mathematical equations.

For those who are also struggling when reading such literature...I call myself "math goldfish" because every time when I look at the mathematical equations in the literature, I feel that I only have 7-second memory of the knowledge I learnt from linear algebra and calculus and have to learn them again. So I decided to write down my own thinking process when reading these literature. It may seem verbose to some super smart genius, but forgive me as a social science student with normal intelligence.
