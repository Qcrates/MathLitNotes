# MathLitNotes

Personal notes with details on some literature in social science but with lots of mathematical equations.

For those who are also struggling when reading such literature...I call myself "math goldfish" because every time when I looked at the mathematical equations in the literature, I feel that I only have 7-second memory of the knowledge I learnt from linear algebra and calculus and have to learn them again. This is just my thinking process as a social science student with normal intelligence, so it may seem verbose for those super smart genius.
